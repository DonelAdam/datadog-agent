    Adding a secondary UDS endpoint to dogstatsd dedicated to telemetry
    metrics. This is useful when used in high throughput scenarios to avoid
    dropping telemetry metrics which prevents users from troubleshooting
    issues. New option is "dogstatsd_socket_telemetry" and is disabled by
    default. This also require the dogstatsd client to send telemetry to a
    custom endpoint, see the clients documentation for more on this.
